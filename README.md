# Ping Monitor
Ping Monitor is a program that allows you to monitor uptime of your network devices by periodically sending Ping or ARP requests. It's quick and easy to set up and works like a charm.

## How to Use
You can simply download the exe file in the latest Release, start it up and you're good to go. You can find more detailed instructions about how to use the program in the help-window, however, it's pretty intuitive.

## Author's Note
Yes, the code is practically unreadable. This is due to a little oopsie that ended up deleting my entire project folder, which is why I had to decompile an exe of the program that I had lying around. I will eventually re-write the program and try not to delete everything again, however, since this was made under time pressure for use in an event, that is not currently my main focus.
